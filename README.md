A slightly less anti-social version of the the [Helvetireader](http://helvetireader.com/) css theme for Google Reader.
It doesn't hide the _People you follow_ link.

You can use the latest css directly from [here](https://github.com/adagios/Social-Helvetireader/raw/master/helvetireader.2.css).

Many thanks to [http://www.hicksdesign.com](Hicksdesign) for the awesome theme.
