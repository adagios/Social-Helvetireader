A slightly less anti-social version of the the [http://helvetireader.com/](Helvetireader) css theme for Google Reader.
It doesn't hide the _People you follow_ link.

You can use the latest css directly from [https://github.com/adagios/Social-Helvetireader/raw/master/helvetireader.2.css](here).

Many thanks to [Hicksdesign](http://www.hicksdesign.com) for the awesome theme.
